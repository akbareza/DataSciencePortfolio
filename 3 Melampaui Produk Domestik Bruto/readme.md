In this Jupyter Notebook project, we will explore several indicators beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to gain a deeper understanding of economic well-being. While GDP has long been a primary measure of a country's economic performance, it fails to capture crucial aspects such as economic inequality and regional disparities.

## Key Indicators

1. **Gross National Income (GNI)**: GNI provides a broader measure of a country's economic activity by including income generated by residents both domestically and abroad.

2. **Gini Ratio**: The Gini ratio is a widely used measure of income inequality. By examining income distribution across the entire population, the Gini ratio helps us understand the level of economic inequality within a country. A higher Gini ratio indicates greater income inequality.

3. **GNI per Capita**: GNI per capita is an indicator that measures the average income earned by each individual in a country. This indicator provides insights into the standard of living and economic well-being at the individual level.

4. **Regional GDP**: While national GDP provides an overall measure of economic output, analyzing regional GDP allows us to uncover variations in economic performance across different regions within a country. This sheds light on regional disparities and highlights areas that may require targeted development efforts.

5. **Regional Gini Ratio**: Similar to the national Gini ratio, the regional Gini ratio focuses on income inequality at the regional level. By examining disparities within regions, we can identify areas that need attention in terms of equitable economic development.

## Data Visualization and Geo-Location Mapping

This notebook also implements data visualization techniques, including geo-location mapping, using the Folium library. We'll create interactive maps to visually represent regional economic indicators, providing a spatial perspective on economic disparities and trends.

## Kaggle Project

This project is also available on Kaggle at the following link: [Melampaui Produk Domestik Bruto](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akbareza/melampaui-produk-domestik-bruto)

Through this notebook, our goal is to demonstrate the significance of these multidimensional indicators in obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of a country's economic well-being. By going beyond GDP and examining factors such as economic inequality and regional disparities, we can develop more informed policies and strategies to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
