# Vehicle Classification for TransJakarta Advertising (Simulated Project)

## Background
TransJakarta is a transportation company. In the upcoming period, the company has a desire to expand its business into the advertising field. Broadly speaking, this advertising business is intended for brands that want to advertise their products on TransJakarta-operated vehicles. It is known that TransJakarta has various types of vehicles and, especially, varying passenger density levels. Therefore, pricing determination is expected to be divided into classes based on specific criteria. **Hence, TransJakarta requires insights to classify their vehicles for pricing determination in advertising spaces on the vehicles, based on the data they possess**.

## Problem Statement
TransJakarta aims to classify their vehicles for pricing determination in advertising spaces on the vehicles based on the data they possess. Consequently, the following questions arise:

1. What is the relationship between the data variables in determining passenger numbers?
2. How is the proportion and quantity of different vehicle types based on available routes?
3. How can the class division be achieved based on data variables?

## Files
The analysis consists of two Jupyter Notebook files:

1. `TransJakartaPassengers2021Cleaning.ipynb`: This notebook outlines the process of cleaning the TransJakarta data to ensure its accuracy and reliability for further analysis.
2. `TransJakartaPassengers2021Analysis.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on the analysis of the TransJakarta data, investigating the relationship between variables and providing insights for pricing and advertising decisions.

The data source of this project consists of two CSV files:
1. `TransJakarta Passengers 2021.csv`: This file consist of Raw Data.
2. `TransJakartaPassengers2021Cleansed.csv`: This file consist of Clean Data for further analysis.
