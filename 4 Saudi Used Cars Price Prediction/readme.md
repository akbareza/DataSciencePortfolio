# Saudi Arabia Used Cars Price Prediction (PERSONAL PROJECT)
Project Disclaimer:

Please note that the project described in this repository is not a real project, but rather a conceptual exercise. It was created to explore ideas and encourage creativity.

## Background
Engaging in the buying and selling of used cars in Saudi Arabia is quite a fascinating activity. According to information from the website www.pajakku.com, there are some great advantages to be gained when dealing with used cars in Saudi Arabia. One of these perks is the exemption from motor vehicle taxes in the country. This encourages people in Saudi Arabia to sell and purchase used cars within the nation.

When it comes to this economic activity, people generally need a helpful guide to determine the right price for a used car. This helps sellers set a fair price based on the car's specifications and ensures they make a profit. At the same time, potential buyers can also find out the prevailing market prices and make a purchase at the most suitable rate.

In light of this opportunity, a company called Syarah wants to create a friendly online marketplace platform catering to aspiring sellers and buyers of used cars. To meet the market's needs in determining the prices of used cars in Saudi Arabia, Syarah is seeking an IT solution.

## Stakeholder
Syarah Company (an online marketplace company for used cars in Saudi Arabia).

## Problem Statement
Based on the given background, the following problems are formulated:
1. How can we predict the prices of used cars in the Saudi Arabian market?
2. What variables influence the pricing of used cars in the Saudi Arabian market?

## Objectives
Based on the aforementioned problems, the following objectives are formulated to address the issues:
1. Develop a machine learning model for predicting the prices of used cars in the Saudi Arabian market.
2. Identify the variables that significantly affect the pricing of used cars in the Saudi Arabian market.

## Limitations
Clearly, there are some limitations to consider for both of these objectives. The usage of the obtained results will be confined to Syarah Company operating in Saudi Arabia. This is due to the dataset being restricted to the records of used cars in Saudi Arabia maintained exclusively by Syarah Company.

## Metric Evaluation

The metrics for evaluation will include RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- RMSE calculates the square root of the average squared errors.
- MAE calculates the average of absolute errors
- MAPE calculates the average percentage error generated by the regression model.

Smaller values of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE indicate a more accurate model in predicting prices.

While taking other metrics into consideration, it is important to note that the main reference metric for determining the value in this case is MAPE. The reason for choosing MAPE in the implemented model is its scale-invariance property. It allows for a fair and standardized comparison of prediction accuracy across different price ranges of used cars. By considering the percentage deviation between predicted and actual prices, MAPE ensures a consistent evaluation of the model's performance.

## Data Information

### Source:

The dataset contains 5624 records of used cars collected from syarah.com. Each row represents a used car. Other information regarding each car is the brand name, model, manufacturing year, origin, options, engine capacity, transmission type, mileage that the car covered, region price, and negotiable.

### Feature:

- Type: Type of used car.
- Region: The region in which the used car was offered for sale.
- Make: The company name.
- Gear_Type: Gear type size of used car.
- Origin: Origin of used car.
- Options: Options of used car.
- Year: Manufacturing year.
- Engine_Size: The engine size of used car.
- Mileage: Mileage of used car	
- Negotiable: True if the price is 0, that means it is negotiable.
- Price: Used car price.
