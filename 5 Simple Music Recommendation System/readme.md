# Simple Music Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a Simple Music Recommendation System using the Content-Based approach with the Similarity Measure being Cosine Similarity. The system suggests music based on the similarity between different songs' features.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is gathered from Kaggle. You can find the dataset and the implementation details in the following Kaggle notebook: [Simple Music Recommendation System Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akbareza/simple-music-recommendation-system).

## Features

- Utilizes Content-Based Filtering to recommend music based on song features.
- Measures similarity between songs using Cosine Similarity.
- Provides a simple and understandable example of building a music recommendation system.

## How It Works

The recommendation system works by analyzing the features of different songs, such as artist, genre, tempo, etc., and then calculating the similarity between these features using the Cosine Similarity measure. Based on the user's preferences and interactions, the system suggests songs that are most similar to their chosen songs.
